                    <h3>1</h3>
                    <p><strong>Elliptical reference:</strong> “If past generations…” It is not clear here what is being
                        referred to: generations of what? The reader is able to infer that this referring to past
                        generations of people, but the reference to people is omitted because this is a common enough
                        phrase that the reference is implicitly understood in this context. In another context, “past
                        generations” could refer to something totally different, e.g. in a virology article,
                        “generations” could refer to generations of virus. Of course, the correct interpretation, that
                        “past generations” also relies on the reader understanding which sense of “generations” is being
                        used here (more below).</p>

                    <p><strong>Word sense ambiguity:</strong> Without reading further, it is unclear which sense of the
                        word “past” is being used. Dictionary.com gives four different entries for “past”(: adjective,
                        preposition, noun, and adverb. It’s clear from the structure of the sentence that here, “past”
                        is acting as an adjective to modify “generations,” but then we must further delineate which
                        sense of the adjective is being used.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Gone by or elapsed in time</li>
                        <li>Having occurred during a time previous to the present</li>
                        <li>Gone by just before the present time</li>
                        <li>Ago</li>
                        <li>Previous, earlier</li>
                        <li>In grammar, a tense that refers to events in time gone by <a
                                href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/past" target="_blank">(Dictionary.com)</a></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Here, “past” using the fifth sense of the adjective—it refers to previous generations of people.
                        However, it would also be possible to interpret this using the second sense of the
                        adjective—e.g. “the generations of the past,” referring to people who belonged to an earlier
                        period in time.</p>

                    <p>It should also be mentioned that the meaning of “generations” is not immediately clear here.
                        While the structure of the sentence makes it clear that it is being used in the noun sense, it
                        is not clear which noun sense is being used. While we implicitly understand that it refers to “
                        group of individuals born and living contemporaneously” <a
                            href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/generation" target="_blank">(Merriam
                            Webster)</a>, it could also refer to second sense of the noun, “the process of coming or
                        bringing into being,” e.g. the generation of income <a
                            href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/generation" target="_blank">(Merriam
                            Webster)</a>. In a financial article, “past generations” could refer to past generations of
                        income.</p>

                    <h3>2</h3>
                    <p><strong>Word sense ambiguity:</strong> It’s not immediately clear here which sense of “saw” is
                        being used. “If past generations saw…” could refer to the past tense of “see” (to perceive with
                        the eyes,” or it could be using “saw” as a verb, indicating to cut something with a tool. The
                        clause “If past generations saw their wanderlust…” could be interpreted as “If past generations
                        cut their wanderlust in half…” </p>
                    <a id="3"></a>
                    <h3>3</h3>
                    <p><strong>Structural ambiguity:</strong> In the sentence “If past generations saw their wanderlust reflected in
                        Alice peering down a rabbit hole…” it is unclear here where the reflection of wanderlust is
                        occurring. It is possible to parse the sentence several different ways: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Alice reflects wanderlust to past generations while Alice peers down a rabbit hole</li>
                        <li>Alice reflects wanderlust to past generations while the past generations peer down a rabbit
                            hole</li>
                        <li>Past generations see wanderlust reflected in the act of Alice peering down a rabbit hole.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr><a id="4"></a>
                    <h3>4</h3>
                    <p><strong>Idiomatic reference:</strong> “Alice peering down a rabbit hole” is an idiomatic reference, an allusion to Lewis Caroll’s <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i>. Through that work, “down a rabbit hole” has become a metaphor for getting into a strange situation. If one were not familiar with the reference, they might interpret the phrase more literally. One might wonder who is Alice, and why she is looking down a rabbit hole. </p>
                    <hr><a id="5"></a>
                    <h3>5</h3>
                    <p><strong>Idiomatic reference:</strong> I’m actually not sure if this is best referred to as an idiomatic reference, or is just a pop culture reference. However, if the reader were not familiar with the reference to Luke Skywalker and the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise, the meaning of the sentence would not be very clear. The reader would be left wondering who the heck this person is, and would also miss out on the reference to the modern hero archetype.</p>
                    <hr><a id="6"></a>
                    <h3>6</h3>
                    <p><strong>Idiomatic reference:</strong> “Staring down a sunset” is an idiom that is hard to define, but evokes a sense of stubbornly engaging in a hopeless, albeit romantic, task. It also evokes the image of the hero riding off into the sunset. It also relies on the reader’s understanding of the idiomatic phrase “to stare down,” which does not mean to literally look in the down direction for an object, but instead to gaze at someone in an intimidating way. Without understanding both the “hero riding into the sunset” metaphor and the idiomatic phrase “stare down,” the reader would be likely to interpret this sentence literally to mean: “Luke Skywalker looking in the down direction at a setting sun.”</p>
                    <hr><a id="7"></a>
                    <h3>7</h3>
                    <p><strong>Idiomatic reference:</strong> “COVID-era” has recently become an idiom to refer to the period of time many countries have recently experienced that requires social distancing restrictions to help slow down the COVID-19 pandemic. The reader needs to know that COVID not only refers to the coronavirus pandemic but also has become shorthand for the social and economic impacts of the virus’ global spread as well. </p>
                    <hr><a id="8"></a>
                    <h3>8</h3>
                    <p><strong>Elliptical reference:</strong> “The COVID-era equivalent” is an elliptical reference. The reader infers that this phrase implicitly reads as “The COVID-era equivalent [of the iconic pop culture images previously mentioned—Alice in Wonderland and Luke Skywalker.]” </p>
                    <hr><a id="9"></a>
                    <h3>9</h3>
                    <p>I’m not sure what to call this, but the ambiguity happens here with the phrase “almost certainly,” which is a contradictory phrase. The adjective “almost” means “not exactly” while the adverb “certainly” means “indisputable” <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/certain" target="_blank">(MW)</a>. Something that is "not exactly indisputable” is, in fact, disputable. Based on the context, readers are able to discern that the phrase “almost certainly” is stylistic rather than literal. 
                        </p>
                    <hr><a id="10"></a>
                    <h3>10</h3>
                    <p><strong>Word Sense ambiguity:</strong> In the phrase “gazing into a screen,” the meaning of “screen” is not clear. From the syntax of the sentence, it is clear that “screen” is being used as a noun, but which noun sense is unclear. A “screen” can be a partition that hides an area from view, netting attached to a window to keep out bugs, a movie screen, an electronic display, etc. Reading further, “televisions and smart devices” are mentioned, so the reader later infers that here “screen” refers to some sort of electronic display.</p>
                    <hr><a id="11"></a>
                    <h3>11</h3>
                    <p><strong>Elliptical reference:</strong> “With most of the U.S…” is intended to mean “Most of the U.S. population,” but “population” is not specifically mentioned, because it is inferred from further details in the sentence: most of the U.S. is advised to stay home, so we infer that the author is referring to people in the U.S. obeying social distancing orders.  Without that context, “Most of the U.S.” could refer to either the physical land of the U.S. or the state governments of the U.S.</p>
                    <hr><a id="12"></a>
                    <h3>12</h3>
                    <p><strong>Combination pronoun reference ambiguity and structural ambiguity:</strong>  The phrase “With most of the of the U.S. advised to stay home as much as possible…” is written in the passive voice. Doing so leads to pronoun ambiguity. Advised by whom? Who is being advised? Without a clear subject, the sentence is more difficult to parse. </p>
                    <hr><a id="13"></a>
                    <h3>13</h3>
                    <p><strong>Idiomatic reference:</strong> The term “smart devices” has recently developed to refer to smartphones, tablets, smart watches, and other personal electronic devises. However, without this idiomatic understanding, the phrase can be confusing. What kinds of devices? “Device” is such a generic term to refer to a functional object that it could refer to many different objects, such as medical instruments or kitchen tools. “Smart” is an adjective usually used to describe people, since it refers to intelligence. How can inanimate devices have intelligence? Of course, the reader infers that “smart” is being used to describe to internet-enabled technology. </p>
                    <hr><a id="14"></a>
                    <h3>14</h3>
                    <p><strong>Structural ambiguity and pronoun reference ambiguity:</strong> The phrase entire phrase “With most of the U.S. still advised to stay home as much as possible, televisions and smart devices feel…” is structurally ambiguous. It is unclear who/what is doing the feeling here. The phrase can be interpreted in a couple of different ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While the U.S. population has been advised by local governments to stay home, televisions and smart devices have developed emotions.</li>
                        <li>While the U.S. population has been advised by local governments to stay home, the population is starting to think of televisions and smart devices as being similar to portals</li>
                        <li>The U.S. population has been advised by local governments to stay home, and for those people, the surface of televisions and smart devices have started to texturally feel the same as the surface of portals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr><a id="15"></a>
                    <h3>15</h3>
                    <p><strong>Simile:</strong> The phrase “televisions and smart devices feel more than ever like flickering portals…” is a simile. The reader infers that the author does not mean that televisions and smartphones literally have a textural feeling that’s similar to a portal, but instead gathers the symbolic meaning that during quarantine, televisions and smartphones have become like doors to other worlds. </p>
                    <hr><a id="16"></a>
                    <h3>16</h3>
                    <p><strong>Word sense ambiguity:</strong> The word “passage” is unclear here. What sense is the author using here? “Passage” could be a noun, referring to “a portion of written work” or “the permission, right or freedom to pass,” or it could be a verb, meaning “to voyage.” <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/passage?s=t" target="_blank">(Dictionary.com)</a>. Even as a native English speaker, I needed to parse this sentence a couple of times to grasp the proper meaning due to the florid prose.</p>
                    <hr><a id="17"></a>
                    <h3>17</h3>
                    <p><strong>Pronoun reference ambiguity and structural ambiguity:</strong> The phrase “promising the addled mind passage to anywhere…” is certainly confusing. There is pronoun ambiguity here due to the phrase being written in the passive voice. Who is doing is the promising? Who is the promise being made to? What is being promised? There are a couple of ways to interpret this: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Televisions and smart devices are promising to give an “addled mind passage” to someone.</li>
                        <li>Televisions and smart devices are promising passage/clearance to an addled mind.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr><a id="18"></a>
                    <h3>18</h3>
                    <p><strong>Idiomatic reference:</strong> “Four walls” idiomatically refers to one’s dwelling, house/home. Without knowing the idiomatic reference, the reader would take a more literal interpretation of four load-bearing structures, which would certainly be confusing. </p>
